# Interpe Internship Java Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Java programming projects completed during my internship at Interpe. This repository contains various fun and interactive Java games that showcase my learning and coding skills developed over the internship.

## Projects Included

1. **Guess a Number**: 
   - A number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number within a given range, and the player must guess the number with feedback given after each guess (higher or lower).
  
2. **Rock Paper Scissors**: 
   - A simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.

3. **Tic Tac Toe:** 
   - A classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

4. **Connect 4**: 
   - A two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective is to connect four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
